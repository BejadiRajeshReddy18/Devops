	 pipe | 
	 
	 cat friend 
	 
	  cat friend | sort




cat filename 


my requirement is i want to see the content in uppercase 

   tr = translate 
   
   
   
   grep command 
   
   grep  name filename 
   
   grep -i 
   
   -i = ignoring the case 
   
   
   sed command :-  stream editor 
   
   sed "s/blue/red/" filename 
   
   s = string 
   
   sed " s/blue/red/g" filename 
   
   g= globally 
   
   
   sed command is going to work on output 
   only 
 
 
 stream = output 
 
 stream means output 
  sed -i  "s/blue/red/g" colours
